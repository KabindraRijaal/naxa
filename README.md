2. The project includes a Header component with the following features:
   - A top banner with information about earthquake response initiatives
   - A navigation menu with dropdown options for Services, Portfolio, and Company
   - A responsive design with a mobile menu for smaller screens
   - Use of Tailwind CSS for styling
